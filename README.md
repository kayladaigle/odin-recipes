# odin-recipes
This is my first project with The Odin Project.
This project starts with basic elements of HTML. It helps prove my knowledge of many different HTML tags.
<a> the anchor tag for linking pages
<img> the image element for displaying images on my web page.
<ul> and <ol> for listing my steps and ingredients.

I will come back to this project later on to bring it to a better level with CSS.
